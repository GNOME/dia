BUILDING:
=========

To build, run:

 ./configure
 make


COMPILING FROM CVS:
===================

If you are using the cvs version of Dia you need to have the following programs:
automake 1.4, autoconf 2.13, libtool 1.2d, GNU gettext 0.10.35

Then run ./automake.sh instead of configure to create all needed files.

TRYING IT OUT:
==============

You can try out dia in the compilation directory by running
 ./app/run_dia.sh

INSTALL:
========
install it by doing:

 make install

By default Dia is installed in /usr/local.
You can change that by passing --prefix=/some/dir to configure.


FONTS:
======
I recommend that you install the URW fonts if you haven't already.
They are free scalable version of the standard postscript fonts.

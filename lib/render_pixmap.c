/* This renderer is similar to RenderGdk, except that it renders onto
 * its own little GdkPixmap, doesn't deal with the DDisplay at all, and
 * uses a 1-1 mapping between points and pixels.  It is used for rendering
 * arrows and lines onto selectors.  This way, any change in the arrow 
 * definitions are automatically reflected in the selectors.
 */

/*
 * 2002-10-06 : Leaved the original comment but removed almost
 * anything else. The 'RendererPixmap' now uses the DiaGdkRenderer which 
 * is the ported to GObject 'RendererGdk'. No more huge code duplication 
 * but only some renderer parametrization tweaking.                 --hb

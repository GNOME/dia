# About

Dia is a program for drawing structured diagrams.

Dia is a GNU program, and is Free Software.  See the COPYING file for the licence.

The official homepage for Dia is at: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/dia

General documentation can be found in the doc/ directory.

If you are thinking of contributing (either code or diagrams), please see (HACKING)[HACKING].

For compilation and installation instructions please see (INSTALL)[INSTALL].

# Bug reporting

Please use the issue tracker on the GitLab page: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/dia/issues

First, have a look at both the existing open & closed issues: maybe somebody has noticed the issues as
well, or maybe it's included in a new version.

If the issue is not there, please report it.  If it, is give it a "thumbs-up" or "+1".  This helps us
prioritise them.

# Contacting us

If you use Dia, we would love to hear from you!

Please feel free to send us comments/feedback/questions on our mailing list:
https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/dia-list

If you don't want to send a full email or just want to say "Hi!", we also hang out on IRC on GimpNet
(irc.gimp.org)[irc.gimp.org] on `#dia-editor` channel.  Dia has been inactive for a few years now so
it is very nice when we hear from people using it.

# We're "hiring"

There is a lot of work to be done in order to bring Dia up to date.  Part of the reason why Dia has
been around for so long is that it is very stable.  We intend to keep it that way.

## General contributions

We would love to have more people on-board helping improving Dia.  For that, the only requirement is
patience :slight_smile:
Software quality comes not from the code itself, but how people develop that code.  As such, we need
to be very nitpicky with what we accept into master and _when_.

Do not be offended: we aren't trying to be mean, control-freaks or in any way belittle your work,
it's simply that good things take time and there's no way to rush quality.
With that in mind, we welcome all contributions, no matter how tiny so please get in touch.

## Windows build maintainer

We currently need somebody to look after the Windows builds and packages.  Most of us use Linux as
our main operating system, so if you use Windows and would like to program on Dia on Windows, for
example, getting it running on Visual Studio + Meson, please get in touch.  Note that this involves
doing full development on Windows and is not limited to just getting it to compile.

## MacOS build maintainer

Similarly to the above, we need somebody to ensure Dia builds and runs well on macOS.

## Documentation writers & translators (German, French, Basque, Polish etc)

Much of the documentation in doc/ is outdated.  We need somebody to go through the documents, check
what is good, update them and then maintain them.  If you enjoy or want to practice technical writing
or would be interested in helping with the translation we would love to hear from you!

## Testers

One simple way to ensure Dia works well for everybody is to test it on as many machines as possible.
This role is simple and is a very good way to get more familiar with the Dia codebase.  Plus, the more
people Dia works for from source, the easier it is for package maintainers and the easier it is for
anybody to contribute patches:

1. Obtain a machine (ARM, ARM64, x86_64, SPARC, doesn't matter) in one or more of the following ways:
  1. Local laptop, desktop, etc
  2. Premade box from https://www.osboxes.org/ or similar
  3. Instal a virtual machine from ISO
2. Follow the compilation & installation instructions for Dia
3. See if you can get all the features of Dia running.
  1. Try various meson options: https://mesonbuild.com/Configuring-a-build-directory.html
  2. Try to install dependencies in a different order.
  3. Try a different compiler
4. If anything is off and hasn't been reported before, let us know!  If it has been reported,
give the issue a "+1".
5. If you've tried your best and haven't found anything wrong, also give us a shout :-)
Let us know what you tried and why you think there aren't any issues on the machine you tested it on.

## Code Gardeners

A few issues are marked as [cleanup].  Normally programmers are interested in creating things, not
removing them.  If you like cleanning code up and believe that "perfection is attained, not when there
is nothing more to add, but when there's nothing left to take away" (Antoine de Saint Exupéry), then
by all means, we look forward seeing your merge requests.

## Public Relations / Marketing

There are many places where people might ask questions, or discuss about Dia that are not actively
monitored by developers.  These, for the time being, include:
 - [SourceForge Tickets](https://sourceforge.net/p/dia-installer/_list/tickets)
 - [SourceForge Discussion](https://sourceforge.net/p/dia-installer/discussion/)
 - [Dia Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_status=NEEDINFO&list_id=325564&order=Importance&product=dia&query_format=advanced)
   - This will end up being removed, but for the time being some might still accidentally use it.
 - Social media, reddit, etc.
If you would like to help, you can do so by monitoring these channels and providing support to users.
This can be as simple as redirecting them to the Gitlab issues if they have a problem
(or reporting the problem for them), or to the mailing list / IRC if they have a question.

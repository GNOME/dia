## About

Dia is a program for drawing structured diagrams.

Dia is a GNU program, and is Free Software.  See the COPYING file for the licence.

The current homepage for Dia is https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/dia.  This however
is fairly new and does not contain a lot of background information.  The previous
homepage was at https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia.  Over there you will find a lot
more information about Dia's history, features, screenshots, GSoC ideas, etc.
Please have a look at both.

General documentation can be found in the [doc/](doc/) directory.

If you are thinking of contributing (either code or diagrams), please see
[HACKING](HACKING.md).

For compilation and installation instructions please see [BUILDING](BUILDING.md).

## Bug reporting

Please use the issue tracker on the GitLab page:
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/dia/issues

First, have a look at both the existing open & closed issues: maybe somebody has
noticed the issues as well, or maybe it's included in a new version.

If the issue is not there, please report it.  Otherwise, give it a "thumbs-up".
This will us prioritise them.

## Contacting us

If you use Dia, we would love to hear from you!

Please feel free to send us comments/feedback/questions on our mailing list:
https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/dia-list

If you don't want to send a full email or just want to say "Hi!", we also hang
out on IRC on GimpNet [irc.gimp.org](irc://irc.gimp.org) on `#dia-editor`
channel.  Dia has been inactive for a few years now so it is always nice to hear
from people (still) using it.

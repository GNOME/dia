# Dia

## About

Dia is a program for drawing structured diagrams.

Dia is a GNU program, and is Free Software.  See the COPYING file for the licence.

The current homepage for Dia is https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/dia.  This however
is fairly new and does not contain a lot of background information.  The previous
homepage was at https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia.  Over there you will find a lot
more information about Dia's history, features, screenshots, GSoC ideas, etc.
Please have a look at both.

General documentation can be found in the [doc/](doc/) directory.

If you are thinking of contributing (either code or diagrams), please see
[HACKING](HACKING.md).

For compilation and installation instructions please see [BUILDING](BUILDING.md).

## Bug reporting

Please use the issue tracker on the GitLab page:
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/dia/issues

First, have a look at both the existing open & closed issues: maybe somebody has
noticed the issues as well, or maybe it's included in a new version.

If the issue is not there, please report it.  Otherwise, give it a "thumbs-up".
This will us prioritise them.

## Contacting us

If you use Dia, we would love to hear from you!

Please feel free to send us comments/feedback/questions on our mailing list:
https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/dia-list

If you don't want to send a full email or just want to say "Hi!", we also hang
out on IRC on GimpNet [irc.gimp.org](irc://irc.gimp.org) on `#dia-editor`
channel.  Dia has been inactive for a few years now so it is always nice to hear
from people (still) using it.

# Help Wanted

There is a lot of work to be done in order to bring Dia up to date.  Part of
the reason why Dia has been around for so long is that it is very stable.
We intend to keep it that way.

## General contributions

We would love to have more people on-board helping improving Dia.  For that,
the only requirement is patience :slight_smile:.  Software quality comes not
from the code itself, but how people develop that code.  As such, we need to
be very nitpicky with what we accept into master and _when_.

Do not be offended: we aren't trying to be mean, control-freaks or in any way
belittle your work, it's simply that good things take time and there's no way
to rush quality.  With that in mind, we welcome all contributions, no matter
how tiny so please get in touch.

## Windows build maintainer

We currently need somebody to look after the Windows builds and packages.
Most of us use Linux as our main operating system, so if you use Windows and
would like to program on Dia on Windows, for example, getting it running on
Visual Studio + Meson, please get in touch.  Note that this involves doing
full development on Windows and is not limited to just getting it to compile.

## MacOS build maintainer

Similarly to the above, we need somebody to ensure Dia builds and runs well
on macOS.

## Documentation writers & translators (German, French, Basque, Polish etc)

Much of the documentation in doc/ is outdated.  We need somebody to go through
the documents, check what is good, update them and then maintain them.  If you
enjoy or want to practice technical writing or would be interested in helping
with the translation we would love to hear from you!

## Testers

One simple way to ensure Dia works well for everybody is to test it on as many
machines as possible.  This role is simple and is a very good way to get more
familiar with the Dia codebase.  Plus, the more people Dia works for from
source, the easier it is for package maintainers and the easier it is for
anybody to contribute patches:

1. Obtain a machine (ARM, ARM64, x86\_64, SPARC, doesn't matter) in one or more
of the following ways:
  1. Local laptop, desktop, etc
  2. Premade box from https://www.osboxes.org/ or similar
  3. Instal a virtual machine from ISO
2. Follow the compilation & installation instructions for Dia
3. See if you can get all the features of Dia running.
  1. Try various meson options: https://mesonbuild.com/Configuring-a-build-directory.html
  2. Try to install dependencies in a different order.
  3. Try a different compiler
4. If anything is off and hasn't been reported before, let us know!  If it has
been reported, give the issue a "+1".
5. If you've tried your best and haven't found anything wrong, also give us a
shout :-) Let us know what you tried and why you think there aren't any issues
on the machine you tested it on.

## Code Gardeners

A few issues are marked as [cleanup].  Normally programmers are interested in
creating things, not removing them.  If you like cleanning code up and believe
that "perfection is attained, not when there is nothing more to add, but when
there's nothing left to take away" (Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry), then by all
means, we look forward seeing your merge requests.

## Public Relations / Marketing

There are many places where people might ask questions, or discuss about Dia
that are not actively monitored by developers.  These, for the time being, include:
 - [SourceForge Tickets](https://sourceforge.net/p/dia-installer/_list/tickets)
 - [SourceForge Discussion](https://sourceforge.net/p/dia-installer/discussion/)
 - [Dia Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_status=NEEDINFO&list_id=325564&order=Importance&product=dia&query_format=advanced)
   - This will end up being removed, but for the time being some might still
   accidentally use it.
 - Social media, reddit, etc.

If you would like to help, you can do so by monitoring these channels and
providing support to users. This can be as simple as redirecting them to the
Gitlab issues if they have a problem (or reporting the problem for them), or
to the mailing list / IRC if they have a question.

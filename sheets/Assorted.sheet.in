<!-- Sheet Name: Assorted, was Geometric, maybe Basic Shapes instead?  
Leave as is for now, renaming too much hassle.  
Will probably need to split into seperate sheets soon anyway.  -->

<_description>An Assorted Collection of Polygons, Beziergons and other Miscellaneous Geometric Shapes</_description>
<!-- I drew a lot of these shapes based on the Autoshapes from Powerpoint 97.  
Also got some ideas from what the rivals 
http://www.microsoft.com/office/visio/evaluation/indepth/samples.asp -->

<contents>

<!-- All Icons 22x22 pixels.  Edited them with the Gimp (and mspaint) 
to get really clean crisp clear looking icons.  Icons should probably 
be numbered to make is easier to identify the shapes.  
Vertically or Horizontally Flipped versions of various shapes 
have been included to save users the effort of flipping them
